# async-queue
An implementation of an async queue in typescript

You can test the code by running:
```
npx ts-node main.ts
```

@ThePrimeagen is this what you mean by knowing how to implement an async queue? You have mentioned multiple times this is something you ask in coding Interviews.

Thanks in advance!
